# Udacity-Data-Scientist-Capstone
Project #4 for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree Program

## Project Motivation
The purpose of this project is to use customer data to help Starbucks become more profitable. The basic task is to use the data to identify which groups of people are most responsive to each type of offer, and how best to present each type of offer.

## Libraries and Installation
- import pandas as pd
- import numpy as np
- import math
- import json
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## File Descriptions 
1. README.md - read me file
2. portfolio.json - contains information about the types of offers offered by Starbucks
3. profile.json - contains demographic data for each customer
4. transcript.json - contains transactional data (i.e. records for offers received, offers viewed, transactions, and offers completed)
5. Starbucks_Capstone_notebook-Copy2.ipynb - notebook with data cleaning and preprocessing steps and final visualizations and outputs.

## Summary of the Results
In summary, sending discount and BOGO offers to customers tend to have the highest offer response rate. Informational offers see less success.
